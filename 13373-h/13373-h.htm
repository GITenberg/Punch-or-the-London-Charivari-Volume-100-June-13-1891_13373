    <h3>AT A MUSIC HALL.</h3>

    <p class="scene">SCENE&mdash;<i>The Auditorium of a Music Hall,
    the patrons of which are respectable, but in no sense "smart."
    The occupants of the higher-priced seats appear to have dropped
    in less for the purpose of enjoying the entertainment than of
    discussing their private affairs&mdash;though this does not
    prevent them from applauding everything with generous
    impartiality.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Chairman</i>. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Celebrated
    Character-Duettists and Variety Artistes, the Sisters
    SILVERTWANG, will appear next!</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>They do; They have just sung a duet in
    praise of Nature with an interspersed step-dance. "Oh, I love
    to 'ear the echo on the Moun-ting!</i>"
    (<i>Tiddity-iddity-iddity-iddity-um!</i>) "<i>And to listen to
    the tinkle of the Foun-ting!</i>" (<i>Tiddity, &amp;c.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>A White-capped Attendant</i> (<i>taking advantage of a
    pause, plaintively</i>). Sengwidges, too-pence!</p>

    <p><i>Voluble Lady in the Shilling Stalls</i> (<i>telling her
    Male Companion an interminable story with an evasive
    point</i>). No, but you 'ear what I'm going to <i>tell</i> you,
    because I'm coming to it presently. I can't remember his name
    at this moment&mdash;something like BUDKIN, but it wasn't that,
    somewhere near Bond Street, he is, or a street off there; a
    Scotchman, but <i>that</i> doesn't matter! (<i>Here she breaks
    off to hum the Chorus of "Good Ole Mother-in-Law!" which is
    being sung on the stage.</i>) Well, let me see&mdash;what was I
    telling you? Wait a minute, excuse <i>me</i>, oh,
    yes,&mdash;<i>well</i>, there was this picture,&mdash;mind you,
    it's a lovely <i>painting</i>, but the frame simply nothing,
    not that I go by frames, myself, o' course not, but I fetched
    it down to show him&mdash;oh, I know what you'll say, but he
    must know <i>something</i> about such things; he knew my uncle,
    and I can tell you what he <i>is</i>&mdash;he's a florist, and
    married nineteen years, and his wife's forty&mdash;years older
    than me, but I've scarcely spoke to <i>her</i>, and no
    children, so I fetched it to show him, and as soon as he set
    eyes on it, he says&mdash;(<i>Female "Character-Comic" on
    Stage, lugubriously</i>. "Ritolderiddle, ol de <i>ray</i>,
    ritolderiddle, olde-<i>ri-ido!</i>") I can't tell you
    <i>how</i> old it is, but 'undreds of years, and Chinese, I
    shouldn't wonder, but we can't trace its 'istry&mdash;that's
    what <i>he</i> said, and if <i>he</i> don't know, <i>nobody</i>
    does, for it stands to reason he must be a judge, though
    nothing to me,&mdash;when I say nothing, I mean all I know of
    him is that he used to be&mdash;(<i>Tenor Vocalist on
    Stage</i>. "My Sweetheart when a Bo-oy!") I always like that
    song, don't you? Well, and this is what I was <i>wanting</i> to
    tell you, <i>she</i> got to know what I'd done&mdash;how is
    more'n <i>I</i> can tell you, but she did, and she come
    straight in to where I was, and I see in a minute she'd been
    drinking, for drink she does, from morning to night, but I
    don't mind <i>that</i>, and her bonnet all on the back of her
    head, and her voice that 'usky, she&mdash;(<i>Tenor</i>. "She
    sang a Song of Home Sweet Home&mdash;a song that reached my
    heart!") And I couldn't be expected to put up with <i>that</i>,
    you know, but I haven't 'alf told you yet&mdash;<i>well</i>,
    &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p class="center">IN THE RESERVED STALLS.</p>

    <p><i>First Professional Lady, "resting" to Second Ditto</i>
    (<i>as</i> Miss FLORRIE FOLJAMBE <i>appears on Stage</i>). New
    dresses, to-night.</p>

    <p><i>Second Ditto</i>. Yes. (<i>Inspects</i> Miss F.'s
    <i>costume</i>.) Something wrong with that boy's dress in
    front, though, cut too low. Is that silver bullion it's trimmed
    with? That silver stuff they put on my pantomime-dress has
    turned quite yellow!</p>

    <p><i>First Ditto</i>. It will sometimes. Did you know any of
    the critics when you were down at Slagtown for the Panto?</p>

    <p><i>Second Ditto</i>. I knew the <i>Grimeshire Mercury</i>,
    and he said most awfully rude things about me in his paper. I
    was rather rude to him at rehearsal, but we made it up
    afterwards. You know LILY'S married, dear?</p>

    <p><i>First Ditto</i>. What&mdash;LILY? You don't mean it!</p>

    <p><i>Second Ditto</i>. Oh, yes, she <i>is</i>, though. She
    went out to Buenos Ayres, and the other day she was taken in to
    dinner by the Bishop of the Friendly Isands.</p>

    <p><i>First Ditto</i>. A Bishop? <i>Fancy!</i> That <i>is</i>
    getting on, isn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Miss Foljambe</i> (<i>on Stage, acknowledging an
    encore</i>). Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very much obliged for
    your kind reception this evening, but having been lately laid
    up with a bad cold, and almost entirely lost my vice, and being
    still a little 'orse, I feel compelled to ask your kind
    acceptance of a few 'ornpipe steps, after which I 'ope to
    remain, Ladies and Gentlemen, always your obedient 'umble
    servant to command&mdash;FLORRIE FOLIJAMBE!</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>Tumultuous applause and
    hornpipe.</i></p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i>. Professor BOODLER, the renowned Imitator of
    Birds, will appear next!</p>

    <p><i>The Professor</i> (<i>on Stage</i>). Ladies and
    Gentlemen, I shall commence by an attempt to give you an
    imitation of that popular and favourite songster, the
    Thrush&mdash;better known to some of you, I daresay, as the
    Throstle, or Mavis! (<i>He gives the Thrush&mdash;which somehow
    doesn't "go.</i>") I shall next endeavour to represent that
    celebrated and tuneful singing-bird&mdash;the Sky-lark. (<i>He
    does it, but the Lark doesn't quite come off.</i>) I shall next
    try to give you those two sweet singers, the Male and Female
    Canary&mdash;the gentleman in the stalls with the yellow 'air
    will represent the female bird on this occasion, he must not be
    offended, for it is a 'igh compliment I am paying him, a
    harmless professional joke. (<i>The Canaries obtain but tepid
    acknowledgments.</i>) I shall now conclude my illustrations of
    bird-life with my celebrated imitation of a waiter drawing the
    cork from a bottle of gingerbeer, and drinking it
    afterwards.</p>

    <p><i>The Voluble Lady in the Shilling Stalls</i> (<i>during
    the performance of a Thrilling Melodramatic Sketch</i>). I've
    nothing to say against her 'usban', a quiet, respectable man,
    and always treated <i>me</i> as a lady, with grey
    whiskers&mdash;but that's neither here nor there&mdash;and I
    speak of parties as I find them&mdash;<i>well. That</i> was a
    Thursday. On the <i>Saturday</i> there came a knock at my door,
    and I answered it, and there was she, saying, as cool as you
    please&mdash;(<i>Heroine on Stage</i>. "Ah, no, no&mdash;you
    would not ruin me? You will not tell my husband?") So I told
    her. "I'm very sorry," I says, "but I can't lend that
    frying-pan to nobody." So I got up. Two hours <i>after</i>, as
    I was going down-stairs, she come out of her room, and
    says,&mdash;"'Allo, ROSE, 'ow <i>are</i> yer?" as if nothing
    had 'appened. "Oh, jolly," I says, or somethink o' that
    sort&mdash;<i>I</i> wasn't going to take no notice of
    <i>her</i>&mdash;and she says, "Going out?" like that. I says.
    "Oh, yes; nothing to stay in for," I says, careless-like; so
    Mrs. PIPER, <i>she</i> never said nothing, and <i>I</i> didn't
    say nothing; and so it went on till Monday&mdash;<i>well!</i>
    Her 'usban' met me in the passage; and he said to
    me&mdash;good-tempered and civil enough, I <i>must</i>
    say&mdash;he said&mdash;(<i>Villain on Stage</i>. "Curse you!
    I've had enough of this fooling! Give me money, or I'll twist
    your neck, and fling you into yonder mill-dam, to drown!") So
    o' course I'd no objection to that; and all she wanted, in the
    way of eatables and drink, she <i>'ad</i>&mdash;no, let me
    finish <i>my</i> story first. Well, just fancy <i>'er</i> now!
    She asked me to step in; and she says, "Ow are you?" and was
    very nice, and I never said a word&mdash;not wishing to bring
    up the past, and&mdash;I didn't tell you
    <i>this</i>&mdash;they'd a kind of old easy chair in the
    room&mdash;and the only remark <i>I</i> made, not meaning
    anythink, was&mdash;(<i>Hero on Stage</i>. "You infernal,
    black-hearted scoundrel! this is <i>your</i> work, is it?")
    Well, I couldn't ha' put it more pleasant than that,
    <i>could</i> I? and old Mr. FITKIN, as was settin' on it, he
    says to me, he says&mdash;(<i>Hero</i>. "Courage, my darling!
    You shall not perish if my strong arms can save you. Heaven
    help me to rescue the woman I love better than my life!") but
    he's 'alf silly, so I took no partickler notice of <i>'im</i>,
    when, what did that woman do, after stoopin' to me, as she 'as,
    times without number&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, is the play over?
    Well, as I was saying&mdash;oh, <i>I'm</i> ready to go if you
    are, and I can tell you the rest walking home.</p>

    <h4>[ MR. PUNCH'S "TABLEAU." SOCIETY IN COURT. ]</h4>

    <p>Up betimes and to the Court at the New Palace of Justice
    hard by the Strand, and near the sign of the Griffin which has
    taken the place of Temple Bar, upon which did stand long ago
    the heads of traitors. There did I see a crowd high and low
    trying to get in. But the custodians and the police mighty
    haughty, but withal courteous, and no one to be admitted
    without a ticket signed by the Lord Chief Justice. And I
    thought it was a good job my wife was not with me. She had a
    great longing to see a sensation action (as the journals have
    it), and she being of a fiery disposition and not complacent
    when refused, might have made an uproar, which would have vexed
    me to the heart. But in truth I found no trouble. It did seem
    to me that they did not see me as I entered in. And plenty of
    room and no crowding, at which I was greatly contented, as I
    love not crushing. Pretty to see the crowd of fine folks! And
    there were those who had opera-glasses. And when the Bench was
    occupied by the Lord Chief Justice&mdash;a stately
    gentleman&mdash;and the other persons of quality, how they did
    gaze! And the dresses of the ladies very fine, and did make the
    place&mdash;which was splendid, and they tell me the largest in
    the building&mdash;like a piece at the play-house! And the
    Counsel, how they did talk! Mighty droll to hear them
    contradict! One would have it that Black was White; which
    convinced me I had fallen into error, until another had it that
    he who had spoken was wrong, and White was Black! Good lack!
    who shall decide when Counsel differ? and I was mightily
    content that I was not on the jury, although one of these good
    people did have the honour of asking a question of His Royal
    Highness. And it was answered most courteously, at which I was
    greatly pleased and contented. Then did I hear the witnesses.
    In a mighty dread that I might be called myself! For that which
    did seem plain enough when he who was in the box was asked by
    his Counsel, did appear all wrong when another questioned him.
    And the Jury, looking wise, and making notes. And it is droll
    to see how civil everyone is to the Jury, who, methinks, are no
    cleverer than any of us? The Lord Chief Justice himself smiling
    upon them, and mighty courteous! And met my friend, A.
    Briefless, Junior, who it seems, is always in the Courts, and
    yet doeth no business. And he did say that it was the strongest
    Bar in England. And he did tell me how Sir Charles was
    eloquent, and Sir Edward was clever at fence, and how young
    Master Gill was most promising. And I noticed how one fair
    Lady, who was seated on the Bench, did seem to arrange
    everything. And many beauties there, who I did gaze upon with
    satisfaction. To see them in such gay attire was a pretty
    sight, and did put my heart in a flutter. And I was pleased
    when the Court adjourned for luncheon; and it did divert me
    much to see what appetites they all had! Some had brought
    sandwiches, and, how they did eat them! But the Lord Chief
    Justice soon back again, and more witnesses examined until four
    of the clock, when the day was over. So home, and described to
    my wife what I had seen, except the damsels.</p>

    <h3>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h3>

    <p><i>Billsbury, Sunday, May 25</i>.&mdash;CHORKLE'S dinner
    came off last night. The dinner-hour was seven o'clock.
    CHORKLE'S house is in The Grove, a sort of avenue of detached
    houses shaded by trees. The Colonel himself was magnificent. He
    wore a most elaborately-frilled shirt-front, with three massive
    jewelled studs. His waistcoat was beautifully embroidered in
    black with a kind of vine-leaf pattern, the buttons being of
    silver, with the regimental badge embossed upon them. His
    handkerchief was a gorgeous one of blue silk. He wore it in his
    waistcoat, carefully arranged, so as to show all round above
    the opening. It looked something like the ribbon of some Order
    at a distance. Mrs. CHORKLE is rather a pleasant woman, with a
    manner which suggests that she is much trampled on by her
    domineering husband. How on earth she ever induced herself to
    marry him I can't make out. The chief guests were Sir CHARLES
    and Lady PENFOLD. Sir CHARLES'S father was a large Billsbury
    contractor, who made no end of money, and represented Billsbury
    in the House a good many years ago. He was eventually made a
    Baronet for his services to the Party. The present Sir CHARLES
    doesn't take much interest in politics, occupying himself
    chiefly in hunting, &amp;c., but they are people of great
    consideration in Billsbury; in fact Lady PENFOLD is the leader
    of Society in Billsbury, and not to know them is to argue
    yourself unknown. Sir CHARLES himself is an Oxford man, and we
    had a good deal of talk about the old place.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, "I was at the House more than thirty years
    ago, and to tell you the truth, it's the only House (with a
    capital H), that I ever wanted te be in."</p>

    <p>The fact of the matter, so JERRAM told me, was that Sir
    CHARLES did once want to stand for Parliament, but somehow or
    other the scheme fell through, and since then he's always
    spoken rather bitterly of the House of Commons. Their daughter,
    whom I took in to dinner, is a very pretty girl of nineteen,
    with plenty to say for herself. She told me they were going to
    be in London for about three weeks in June and July, so I hope
    to see something of them. Besides the PENFOLDS there were Mr.
    and Mrs. TOLLAND; Mrs. TOLLAND in a green silk dress with more
    gold chains wound about various parts of her person than I ever
    saw on any other woman. Two officers of CHORKLE'S Volunteers
    were there with their wives, Major WORBOYS, an enormous,
    red-whiskered man who doesn't think much, privately, of
    CHORKLE'S ability as a soldier, and Captain YATMAN, a dapper
    little fellow, whose weakness it is to pretend to know all
    about smart Society in London.</p>

    <p>Altogether there were twenty guests. Precisely at seven
    o'clock a bugle sounded on the landing outside the drawing-room
    to announce dinner. Everything in the CHORKLE family is done by
    bugle-calls. They have <i>reveill&eacute;</i> at 7 A.M., the
    sergeants' call for the servants' dinner, and lights out at
    eleven o'clock every night. As soon as the call was finished,
    CHORKLE went up to Lady PENFOLD. "Shall we march, Lady
    PENFOLD?" he said. "Sir CHARLES will bring up the rear with
    Mrs. C." And thus we went down-stairs.</p>

    <p>The dinner was a most tremendous and wonderful
    entertainment, and must have lasted two hours, at the very
    least. There were two soups, three fishes, dozens of
    <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, three or four joints&mdash;the mere
    memory of it is indigestive. The talk was almost entirely about
    local matters, the chief subject of discussion being the
    Mastership of the Foxhounds. The present Master is not going to
    keep them on, as he is a very old man, and everybody seems to
    want Sir CHARLES to take them, but he hangs back. Difficulties
    about the subscription, I fancy.</p>

    <p>In the middle of dinner there was a fiendish row outside. I
    saw poor Mrs. CHORKLE turn pale, while the Colonel got purple
    with fury, and upset his champagne as he turned to say
    something to the butler. Discovered afterwards that the
    disturbance was caused by two of the young CHORKLES, who had
    got out of their bedrooms, and were lying in ambush for the
    dishes. HOBBES LEVIATHAN CHORKLE had carried off a dish of
    sweetbreads, for which STRAFFORD THOROUGH CHORKLE had expressed
    a liking. The result was, that HOBBES LEVIATHAN got his head
    punched by STRAFFORD THOROUGH, who then rubbed his face with
    sweetbread.</p>

    <p>After dinner there was music, but not a whiff of
    tobacco.</p>

    <h3>MITRED MISERY.</h3>

    <p><i>June 6th</i>.&mdash;Rather gratifying to find that my
    service to the Church&mdash;I don't mean Church
    Services&mdash;have at length been recognised. Just received
    intimation of my appointment to Bishopric of Richborough. How
    wild it <i>will</i> make my dear old friend, Canon STARBOTTLE,
    to be sure! Well&mdash;I must accept it as a <i>call</i>, I
    suppose!</p>

    <p><i>July</i>.&mdash;Had no idea being made a Bishop was such
    an expensive business. No end of officials connected with
    Cathedral, all of whom demand their fee. After spending at
    least &pound;500 in this way, found there was an additional fee
    of a hundred guineas for "induction into the temporalities." As
    there are <i>no</i> temporalities nowadays, this is simply
    extortion. Remarked so to the Dean, who replied (nastily, I
    think), "Oh, it's for the interest of the Church not to have
    <i>paupers</i> for Prelates." I retorted at once, rather ably,
    that "I could not conceive a better plan for bringing Prelates
    to pauperism than the exaction of extortionate fees at
    Installation." Dean replied, sneeringly, "Oh, if you don't
    value the honour, I suppose there's still time for you to
    resign." Resign, yes; but should I get back my five or six
    hundred pounds?</p>

    <p><i>Next year</i>.&mdash;Strange, how I seem to be singled
    out for preferment. Am to be "translated," it seems, to diocese
    of Minchester. Can't very well refuse, but really am only just
    getting over drain on my purse last year owing to my accepting
    Bishopric <i>here</i>. And on inquiry, find that fees at
    Minchester much heavier than anywhere else! Is this really a
    call? Certainly a call on my pocket. And my family cost such a
    tremendous lot. And then I've had to do up the Palace, left by
    my predecessor in a perfectly <i>shocking</i> state of
    disrepair!</p>

    <p><i>Later</i>.&mdash;My worst apprehensions were realised!
    Fee for Consecration <i>huge!</i> Fee for Installation,
    <i>monstrous!</i> Fee for Investiture, a perfect
    <i>swindle!</i> Isn't there a song beginning "Promotion is
    vexation, Translation is as had?" Translation is <i>worse!</i>
    Shall really have to consider whether there would be anything
    unepiscopal in negotiating a little loan, or effecting a
    mortgage on the Palace.</p>

    <p><i>Year Later</i>.&mdash;Have been offered vacant
    Archbishopric! No, thanks! Late Archbishop almost swamped by
    the fees, and <i>he</i> was a rich man. I am a poor
    man&mdash;thanks to recent preferments&mdash;and can't afford
    it. An Archbishop in the Bankruptcy Court would <i>not</i> look
    well. "His Grace attributed his position to expenses connected
    with the various Installation ceremonies, and offered a
    composition of one-and-sixpence in the pound, which was
    unanimously declined by the creditors." When <i>will</i> they
    do away with gate-money in the Church?</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Some <i>savants</i> were the other day puzzling their heads
    to find a convenient and familiar word for the illumination
    produced by the electric spark. Surely it is
    <i>Edisunlight</i>.</p>

    <h2>"BEROOFEN !"</h2>

    <p>"Well," quoth the Baron DE BOOK-WORMS, as he sat down to
    dinner on a Friday, a week ago, "I must say I have never, never
    been better in my life! Why, dear me, it is quite a year since
    I was ill!"</p>

    <p>"<i>Beroofen!</i>" exclaimed an Italian Countess of dazzling
    beauty, at the same time rapping the table with one of the
    bejewelled forks which form part of the Baron's second-best
    dinner-service.</p>

    <p>"Why '<i>Beroofen</i>'?" asked the Baron.</p>

    <p>"It is a spell against the consequences of boasting," the
    lady explained. "My mother was a bit of a magician."</p>

    <p>"And you, my dear Countess, are bewitching. Your health!"
    And, pledging her, the Baron drank off a bumper of Pommery '80
    <i>tr&egrave;s sec</i>, and laughed joyously at the notion of
    his rapping the table&mdash;all "table-rapping" being a past
    superstition, or supperstition when not at dinner,&mdash;and
    murmuring, "<i>Beroofen!</i>" And so he didn't do it.
    "<i>Beroofen</i>" never passed his lips: the champagne did; but
    not "<i>Beroofen</i>."</p>
    <hr />

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/281-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Baron and Countess" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Ugh I&mdash;I feel so shivery-and-livery. Ugh!&mdash;so
    chilly. Here! Send for Dr. ROBSON ROOSTEM PASHA!" cried the
    Baron, clapping his hands, and a thousand ebon slaves bounded
    off to execute his commands. Had they not done so, they
    themselves might have suffered the fate intended for the
    commands, and have themselves been rapidly executed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"You've got 'em," quoth Dr. ROBSON ROOSTEM PASHA.</p>

    <p>"Not 'again'!" cried the Baron, surprised, never having had
    'em before.</p>

    <p>"No: the <i>phenomena</i>," said the Eminent Medico.</p>

    <p>"Have I?" murmured the Baron, and sank down into his uneasy
    chair. It was an awful thing to have the Phenomena. It might
    have been the measles in Greek. Anything but that! Anything but
    <i>that!</i> But Dr. ROOSTEM explained that "<i>phenomena</i>"
    is not Greek for measles, though perhaps Phenomenon might be
    Greek for "one measle;" but this would be singular, very
    singular.</p>

    <p>"I must tap you," continued the friend-in-need.
    "No&mdash;no&mdash;don't be alarmed. When I say 'tap,' I mean
    <i>sound</i> you."</p>

    <p>Then he began the woodpecking business. In the character of
    Dr. Woodpecker he tapped at the hollow oak chest, sounded the
    Baron's heart of oak, pronounced him true to the core, whacked
    him, smacked him, insisted upon his calling out "Ninety-nine,"
    in various tones, so that it sounded like a duet to the old
    words, without much of the tune&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"I'm ninety-nine,</p>

            <p>I'm ninety-nine!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>the remainder of which the Baron had never heard, even in
    his earliest childhood.</p>

    <p>So it was a quarter of an hour of inspiration, musical and
    poetic, and, at its expiration, Dr. MARK TAPLEY, as the Baron
    declared he must henceforth be called, announced that there was
    nothing for it but to make the Baron a close prisoner in his
    own castle, where he would have to live up to the mark, as if
    he were to be shown, a few months hence, at a prize
    cattle-show, among other Barons of Beef.</p>

    <p>"Champagne Charley is your name, so is Turtle soup, so is
    succulent food, and plenty of it. Generally provision the
    fortress, and withstand the assaults of the enemy. If a
    bacillus creeps in through a loophole, knock him on the head
    with the best champagne at hand, and, if you're not worse in a
    day or two, you'll be better in a week! <i>Au revoir!</i>"
    <i>Exit</i> Dr. MARK TAPLEY.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>And so the Baron remained within, and sent for his books,
    and above all <i>One of Our Conquerors</i>, by "The GEO. M.,"
    who is the CARLYLE of Novelists. The first volume was missing.
    In a few days it had returned. The first chapters, however,
    seemed still wandering. But the Baron was better, and could
    follow them slowly, though not without effort, wondering
    whither he was being led. When he arrives at Chapter VII.,
    unless the novelist ceases to meander, the Baron will exclaim
    with <i>Hamlet</i>, "Speak! I'll go no further!" Yet, 'tis
    marvellous clever and entertaining withal.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Perhaps there will be a vacation after this attack of Miss
    Influenza on the unfortunate Baron. Alas! for the present, it
    is <i>La Donna Influenza</i> who is "<i>One of Our
    Conquerors!</i>"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>This morning, after a fortnight of it, the Baron was about
    to announce that he was better, but at the outset he paused,
    corrected himself, and, tapping the breakfast-table with his
    fork, he exclaimed, "<i>Beroofen!</i>"</p>

    <p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;Be quite sure you're out of the wood,
    though maybe you were never in it, and <i>even then</i> don't
    congratulate yourself. "Mumm"'s the word (so's "Pommery" also
    by the way, not forgetting "Greno," all such being excellent
    Fizzic for the Epidemic), as to your state of health, and don't
    forget the charm&mdash;"<i>Beroofen!</i>"</p>

    <h3>OPERATIC NOTES.</h3>

    <p>We're quite the gay Frenchmen now at the Italian Opera:
    <i>Faust</i> in French, <i>Manon</i> in French, <i>Rom&eacute;o
    et Juliette</i> in French, <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i> in French;
    American singers, and Dutch singers&mdash;for if Mr. VAN DYCK
    isn't as much a Double Dutchman as VANDERDECKEN or any other
    Van, except PICKFORD &amp; CO.'s, then am I myself a Dutch
    native&mdash;and, by the way, I'm always equal to a dozen of
    'em any time during the right and proper season. Not for many a
    long day and night has there been a better show at Covent
    Garden. Miss EAMES, the Brothers DE RESZK&Eacute;, VAN DYCK,
    MELBA; the two RAVOGLI girls, specially GIULIA, as tuneful
    contralto; MAUREL, the cultured artist; SIBYL SANDERSON, the
    simple child of Nature; AGNES JANSON, with more sauce
    Hollandaise; marvellous MRAVINA for the French Queen, "with a
    song;" and, above all, Madame ALBANI, in tip-top voice, acting
    and singing better than ever.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;June 2 was a Diamond Night in front.
    H.R.H.'s present: Diamond Queens and Princesses of Society all
    on view. DRURIOLANUS, in his glory, beams on everyone.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;State Ball counter-attraction to
    Opera. Won't do to go in rumpled silks and satins, and drooping
    feathers, like hens after the rain, to a Court Ball. So Opera
    suffers; those present trying to look as if they had been
    invited to State Ball, but didn't care about going, or couldn't
    go, on account of recent family affliction. However, as
    DRURIOLANUS is reported to have appeared in full fig at State
    Ball, he couldn't expect others less interested in the
    performance than himself to cut the Court and come to the
    Opera. To-night, M. PLANCON as <i>Mephistopheles</i>, a thinner
    demon than Brother NED DE RESZK&Eacute;, but <i>un bon diable
    tout de m&ecirc;me</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Notable for excellent performance
    of <i>Rigoletto</i>, or The Little Duke and The Big Duck
    respectively personified by Signor RAVELLI and GIULIA RAVOGLI.
    Three "R"s in such a combination. Quite "<i>R's Poetica</i>."
    Beg pardon.</p>

    <p>"Tag" on the week,&mdash;if our friends in front are pleased
    as they appear to be, then DRURIOLANUS and Council&mdash;not
    the County, but the Covent Garden Council&mdash;are satisfied.

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>Messrs. R. Osgood &amp; Co. in advertising Miss SARAH ORME
    JEWETT'S book, <i>Strangers and Wayfarers</i>, quotes an
    extract from one of Mr. RUSSEL LOWELL'S letters, which runs
    thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I remember once at a dinner of the Royal Academy, wishing
    there might be a toast in honour of the Little Masters, such as
    TENNIEL, DU MAURIER, and their fellows."</p>

    <p>He "wished" it, but was the wish a silent one, or did it
    find expression in a speech? No matter: there are the Old
    Masters and the Young Masters, there are the Middle-Aged
    Masters; there are the Great Masters; and, according to Mr.
    RUSSELL LOWELL, there are "the Little Masters," without any
    middle term at all. "The Little Masters," like children in the
    nursery of Art, not admitted to dinner, but who come in
    afterwards for dessert. May they come in for their just
    deserts, as no doubt they will some day. Well, according to
    this Lowelly estimation of merit, these would be the Lesser
    Masters, and after them the No Masters at all, except perhaps
    the Toast-Masters. But why not follow a kind of public school
    classification which divides one form&mdash;of course all the
    artists belong to the very best form, and, like Sir FREDERICK
    the President, show the very best form&mdash;into several
    compartments, so that we should have in one form say, the
    Fifth, Upper Fifth, Middle Fifth, subdivided into Upper and
    Lower Middle, then Lower Fifth, with a similar subdivision?
    Orders of merit to be worn in the button-hole could then be
    distributed, and a new Order of the "B.P.", not "British
    Public," but "Brush and Pencil," could be instituted, to be
    entitled fully, "<i>The Masters of the Black and White
    Art</i>."</p>

    <p>In the <i>Fortnightly</i>, besides an article on the
    prevailing epidemic, by Sir MORRELL MACKENZIE, M.D., which
    finishes with much the sort of general advice that was given by
    <i>Mr. Justice Starleigh</i> to <i>Sam Weller</i>, to the
    effect that "You had better be careful, Sir," whoever you are,
    who read this short, but generally interesting paper. There is
    an anonymous paper on an imaginary election at the Royal
    Academy, noticeable only for an excellent imitation of Mr.
    GEORGE MEREDITH'S style. The Novelist is supposed to look in
    casually, and, finding an election imminent, he offers sage
    words of counsel, and then begs to be allowed to "float out of
    their orbit by a bowshot." It seems to me that the paper was
    written for the sake of this one short paragraph, which, as a
    close parody, is inimitable. <i>A Modern Idyll</i>, by the
    Editor, Mr. FRANK HARRIS, is, as far as this deponent is
    concerned, like the Rule of Three in the ancient Nursery Rhyme,
    for it "bothers me," and, though written with considerable
    dramatic power, yet it seems rather the foundation for a novel
    which the Author felt either disinclined to continue, or unable
    to finish. ALTER HEGO (<i>in the Office of the B. de

    <p>It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled, the rain
    pelted, and the poor travellers were drenched to the skin. They
    shaded their eyes, and peered forth into the blackness to see
    if succour was at hand. Their strength was exhausted, and they
    felt they could go no further. Oh! what would they not have
    given to be once more on board the tight little craft they had
    abandoned! But no! it was not to be. They must seek for help
    from another quarter! Suddenly there emerged from the darkness
    a strange-looking structure, that with its lights seemed bent
    upon running them down. They signalled for help, and the
    grotesque vessel was hove to.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" asked a gruff voice, to their great
    delight, in English. "What are you a haling us for?"</p>

    <p>"We are shipwrecked travellers," explained the spokesman of
    the party; "and we ask for conveyance to a place of
    safety."</p>

    <p>"A place of safety&mdash;sounds like a cab-stand," muttered
    the other. "Well, jump in." Thus invited, the shipwrecked
    travellers entered what seemed to them to be a welcome harbour
    of refuge. But they had not proceeded far when the man who had
    already spoken to them again addressed them.</p>

    <p>"Come&mdash;all of you&mdash;turn out&mdash;but first pay
    me," and then he mentioned a considerable sum of money.</p>

    <p>"Have you no mercy?" cried a fair-haired girl, pointing to
    the white and rain-drenched locks of her ancient parents.</p>

    <p>"Not a bit, Miss," returned the semi-savage, with a hideous
    grin.</p>

    <p>"And who are you, rude man?" she asked, plucking up in her
    very despair some spirit. "Are you the Captain?"</p>

    <p>"Much the same thing&mdash;I am called the Conductor."</p>

    <p>"And what is the name of this dreadful conveyance?" again
    questioned the damsel, with a shuddering glance at what seemed
    to be a straw-strewn cabin.</p>

    <p>"It is called," replied the man, defiantly, "the Pirate
    Bus!" On hearing this, the entire party uttered a despairing
    cry, and fainted!</p>

    <h2>THE TRAVELLER'S FRIEND.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>A Hint for the coming Holidays.</i>)</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;As we are within measurable distance
    of the time when everyone will be thinking of going abroad,
    perhaps you will allow me to make a practical suggestion. No
    doubt you will have observed that, according to the
    Correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, recounting the "recent
    railway outrage in Turkey," the Brigands "chose five of the
    most opulent-looking of their victims, and told them that they
    meant to hold them to ransom." I am not surprised at this
    occurrence, for something of the same sort once happened to me.
    I am very well to do, and I am fond of what I believe is
    vulgarly called "globe-trotting." I do not care to be
    encumbered with too much luggage, and if there is a thorn to
    the rose of my sweet content it is the objection that my wife
    makes to my personal appearance. She will have it that a suit
    of thoroughly comfortable dittos is not the proper garb for a
    stroll on the Boulevards des Italiens, or a lounge on the
    Piazza San Marco. As for my wide-awake, she declares (and I can
    assure you that I have not had it for more than ten years) it
    is absolutely disgraceful!</p>

    <p>But to my story. I have said that I myself was once attacked
    by Brigands. Our train was stopped in strictly regulation
    fashion. I believe the customary number of engine-drivers,
    stokers, and guards were shot, or otherwise accounted for. Then
    the passengers were inspected. I was rather nervous, for, truth
    to tell, my pockets were lined with untold gold and notes. The
    Chief of the Brigands&mdash;a most gentlemanly
    person&mdash;glanced at my coat with a slight shudder of pain,
    and then raised his eyes to my head-gear. That seemed to
    satisfy him. "Set him free!" he cried to the two ruffians who
    guarded me, "and never let him see me again!" I never did!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 1.</i>&mdash;House of
    Commons, as usual at this time of Session, driven against wall
    in its struggles with appointed work. With brief recesses, been
    at work since November last. One thing everyone insists on is
    that Prorogation shall take place at end of July. Difficult to
    see how even by most masterly management that can be
    accomplished. Apart from Education Bill, enough work in hand,
    if Supply be fairly dealt with, to carry us on to last week in
    July. Every moment precious; every quarter of an hour lost an
    irretrievable misfortune.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, to-day, meeting in the freshness and vigour of
    new week, House takes up a local Bill dealing with pilotage in
    Bristol Channel. Two or three Members talk about it for hour
    and a half. House neither knowing nor caring anything on
    subject, empties; Division bell sounds through all the rooms
    and corridors. How is a man to vote when the question abruptly
    submitted is, "That the Pilotage Provisional Orders No. 1 Bill
    be now read a Second Time?" Still, it's as well to vote, as it
    runs up average attendance on Divisions, at which at election
    times constituents sometimes glance. Fortunately, in this case,
    MICHAEL BEACH, as one of Members for Bristol, took part in
    Debate and Division. As useful this as sign-post to belated
    traveller at four cross-roads. Conservatives and Liberals
    crowded at Bar keep their eye on President of Board of Trade,
    watching which way he would go. He led the way into the "Aye"
    lobby. Thither followed him all the Conservatives, all the
    Liberals trooping into the "No" lobby. When Noses were counted,
    it was found that 165 voted "Aye," 119 "No." And thus it came
    to pass that the Pilotage Provisional Order No. 1 Bill was read
    a Second Time.</p>

    <p>One gathered from chance expressions, and especially from
    the interest taken in the affair by Members for City of
    Bristol, that Bristol had special interest in the Bill. In
    addition to MICHAEL BEACH'S support, WESTON on Liberal side,
    HILL on Conservative Benches, supported Second Reading. Sinking
    political differences, Member for East Bristol, and Member for
    South Bristol, agreed upon plan of campaign.</p>

    <p>"You, WESTON," said Colonel HILL who, having obtained his
    military rank in the peaceful pursuits of commercial shipping,
    is a master of strategy, "speak so low that they can't hear a
    word you say, whilst I, concealing a miniature speaking-trumpet
    in my mouth, will roar at them as if a stout North-Easter were
    blowing through the lanyards of our first battalion, deployed
    in open order."</p>

    <p>Tactics succeeded admirably. Sir JOSEPH WESTON, a mild,
    aldermanic person, presented himself from quarter behind Front
    Opposition Bench, and, to all appearances, delivered an
    admirable address. His lips moved, his right hand marked the
    rhythm of his ordered speech; now his eyes flashed in
    reprobation, and anon smiled approval. But not a sound, save a
    soft murmur, as of distant dripping waterfall, was heard.
    <i>L'Enfant Prodigue</i> wasn't in it for successful
    pantomime.</p>

    <p>When the movement stopped, and the Alderman was discovered
    to be sitting down, the martial-nautical HILL sprang up from
    Bench on other side, and the stillness was broken by a rasping
    voice, that woke DICKY TEMPLE out of his early slumber. The
    strategy, cleverly conceived, was admirably carried out, and
    Bristol, thanks to diversified talent of its Members, got its
    Bill. Only it seemed a pity that an hour and a half of precious
    public time should incidentally have been appropriated.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Irish Land Bill in report
    stage.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;House of Lords the scene of a
    thrilling performance to-night. Usually meets for business at
    half-past four. On Tuesdays, in order to give Noble Lords
    opportunity for preparing for exhaustive labours, public
    business does not commence till half-past
    five.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"
       id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>

    <p>Punctually at that hour, a solitary pedestrian might have
    been observed walking up the floor of the historic Chamber. A
    flowing gown hid, without entirely concealing, his graceful
    figure; a full-bottomed wig crowned his stately head, as the
    everlasting snows veil the lofty heights of the Himalayas. He
    looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, but with
    swinging stride strode forward. At the end of the Chamber stood
    the Throne of England, on which, in days gone by, HARCOURT'S
    Plantagenet fathers sat, and in which some day&mdash;who
    knows?&mdash;the portly frame of him who now proudly bears the
    humble title, SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, may recline.</p>

    <p>But that is another story. The gowned-and-wigged figure
    observed walking up the floor of the House of Lords at
    half-past five on a June evening, was not making for the
    Throne. Before that piece of furniture stood a bench, in
    appearance something like the familiar ottoman of the suburban
    drawing-room. It was the Woolsack, and the <i>svelte</i>
    figure, swinging towards it with the easy stride of superlative
    grace and comparative youth, was the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR!
    Before him, at respectful distance, went his Purse-bearer,
    ready to produce the wherewithal should his Lordship desire a
    pick-me-up by the way. Behind him came the Mace-bearer, and, a
    foot further in the rear, Black Rod.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/288-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/288-1.png"
             alt="Accommodated with a Seat." /></a><b>"Accommodated
             with a Seat."</b>
    </div>

    <p>Odsfakins! a stately procession, which ought to have been
    set in the centre of an admiring multitude. But the LORD
    CHANCELLOR'S springy footfall echoed through an almost empty
    chamber. DENMAN was faithful at his post, ready to move that
    some Bill be read a Second Time on that day nine months. Here
    and there, on widely severed benches, perched a Peer, whilst
    from the Gallery, where he had been accommodated with a seat,
    the smiling mobile face of Mr. Justice DAY peered forth. He had
    just looked in on his way home from the Courts, interested in a
    scene where some day he may take his place as Brother BRAMWELL
    and Brother COLERIDGE have done.</p>

    <p>The keen eyes of the great LORD CHANCELLOR flashed round the
    chilling scene. Clerk at the table mumbled something about
    Provisional Orders.</p>

    <p>"Those that are of that opinion say 'Content,'" observed the
    LORD CHANCELLOR. "Contrary, 'Not Content;' the Contents have
    it. This House will now adjourn."</p>

    <p>Then uprose the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, and with the same
    stately swinging step, moved towards the doorway, with the
    Purse-bearer, the Mace-bearer, and Black Rod in his train. It
    was twenty-five minutes to Six; full five minutes had elapsed
    since the House of Lords met. Now House of Lords had adjourned,
    and the throbbing pulses of an Empire on which the sun never
    sets beat with steadier motion, knowing that all was well.
    <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House of Lords adjourned.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Rather a painful scene just now
    between PRINCE ARTHUR and the SQUIRE of MALWOOD. T.W. RUSSELL
    proposed new Clause on Irish Land Bill, which provided for
    re&iuml;nstatement of evicted tenants; received with general
    applause, and finally agreed to. In the midst of general
    congratulations and shaking hands, the SQUIRE lounged in, and
    with many back-handed slaps at the Government, added his
    approval to the general chorus. The Ministry were hopelessly
    bad, but this clause, though proposed by a supporter of theirs,
    was moderately good.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/288-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Balfour, Q.C." /></a><b>Balfour, Q.C.</b>
    </div>

    <p>"Singular thing," said Prince ARTHUR, in meditative tone, as
    if he were talking to himself, "that the Right Hon. Gentleman
    can never interfere in debate, however far removed the subject
    may be from the arena of Party Politics, without forthwith
    dragging it into the arena."</p>

    <p>"That," said BALFOUR, Q.C., who chanced to be on the Front
    Opposition Bench, "is a striking example of the misapprehension
    under which acute minds occasionally labour. I have known my
    Right Hon. friend for many years; we have sat on this Bench
    together in Opposition, and have worked in the same Ministry,
    and I confess it is a little shocking to me to hear him accused
    of tendency to enter upon controversial topics. I am myself a
    man of peace, and do not readily assume an attitude of reproof;
    but, as Mr. HENRY ARTHUR WILSON said when he stood over the
    improvised Baccarat-table with a piece of chalk in his hand,
    the line must be drawn somewhere, and I am inclined to rule it
    at the place where my friend HARCOURT is accused of wilfully
    and designedly disturbing the Parliamentary peace." <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Still on the Land Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Still grinding away at the report
    stage of Land Bill; don't get any forrader; been at it a week,
    and to-night just as many Amendments on the paper as there were
    on Monday. All night upon a single new Clause. Everybody
    wearied to death. Even WINDBAG SEXTON a little moody; not had
    such a good night as usual; the debate lasting throughout
    sitting, and, there being only one Motion before the House,
    SEXTON (with the SPEAKER in the Chair) could speak only once;
    that he did, at considerable length. But a poor consolation for
    lost opportunity.</p>

    <p>Congratulated the suffering SPEAKER on this accident;
    pointed out to him things were bad enough; but might be
    worse.</p>

    <p>"I suppose, TOBY," he said, "you never read PRIOR? Haven't
    looked him up for many years; but, sitting here through this
    week, there is one couplet&mdash;from his <i>Solomon</i>, I
    think&mdash;ever running through my mind:&mdash;</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    added the name of Mr. W.S. GILBERT, <i>Poet and Dramatist, to
    the Commission of the Peace for the County of Middlesex.</i>"
    So is it said that another "W.S.," one WILLIAM
    SHAKSPEARE&mdash;who, by the way, also had a GILBERT in the
    family&mdash;was, in his latter years, made a J.P." Mr. WILLIAM
    SHAKSPEARE GILBERT&mdash;if he will kindly allow us so to style
    him, as uniting the qualities of poet and

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
